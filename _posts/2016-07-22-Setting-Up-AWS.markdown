![AWS Set Up](http://yumio.net/assets/aws_setup_page.png)

**Success!**  Although it took a lot longer than it should, I finally figured out how to setup an AWS EC2 instance with Ruby on Rails pre-installed and setup, and ready! At first the AWS console looked forbidding, but once you stare at it for like 5 minutes, its not that different than setting up admin/user permissions on Windows.  And I even setup the AWS command line interface.

While the [online guide for AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cli/) is a little convoluted, anyway I finally was able to get to my IP address for aftershoolio - my webapp that I plan to turn into a great dynamic and interactive website.
