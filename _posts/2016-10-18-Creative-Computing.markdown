What is creative computing?  Here is a reputable source, Harvard Graduate School of Education, who has come up with an eloquent definition that I copy in full because I couldn't have put it any better. [link](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/)

*Creative computing is...*
**creativity**.
Computer science and computing-related fields have long been introduced to young people in a way that is disconnected from their interests and values – emphasizing technical detail over creative potential. Creative computing supports the development of personal connections to computing, by drawing upon creativity, imagination, and interests.

*Creative computing is...*
**empowerment.**
Many young people with access to computers participate as consumers, rather than designers or creators. Creative computing emphasizes the knowledge, practices, and fundamental literacies that young people need to create the types of dynamic and interactive computational media that they enjoy in their daily lives.

*Creative computing is...*
**computing.**
Engaging in the creation of computational artifacts prepares young people for more than careers as computer scientists or programmers. It supports young people’s development as computational thinkers – individuals who can draw on computational concepts, practices, and perspectives in all aspects of their lives, across disciplines and contexts.

Although I don't entirely agree that Scratch is the right framework to teach Creative Computing, these are exactly the sentiments of Penguin Coding School.
