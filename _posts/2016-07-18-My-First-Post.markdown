This is my first post.  I'm still learning how to do everything. 
In the last 4 days I've learned the following:

* Basic HTML
* Basic CSS
* Basic Javascript
* Basic git
* Basic Markdown

I used [Code Academy][Code Academy] and [Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) Obviously I still have a lot to learn, but its exciting to finally have the time to learn the basics of web coding. 

Its amazing that I've worked in the tech industry for over a decade and made it all the way to VP of Product (incl. Google & Yahoo!) without knowing some of these basic things.  Equally amazing is that all of this knowledge is available for free online via sites like [Code Academy][Code Academy] and [Coursera][Coursera].  

You would think that given the substantial gap between demand for tech workers who can code and the large un- and under-employment of under-educated Americans (and in the world), there would be some efficient solution that trains the underemployed with coding skills - but alas there are reasons why this doesn't happen, namely:

1. it is hard to teach coding to the under-educated
2. the sought-after and well paid tech jobs are not in simple coding, but in sophisticated coding that requires more than rudimentary knowledge of HTML
3. basic coding jobs are already being outsourced to India, Eastern Europe and other low wage countries
