Since I started working at home on my startup, I realized I lost like a pound a day.  I've lost 7 pounds in the last week.  Largely this is due to only eating once a day.  In order to boost my productivity, I stopped eating lunch to avoid the 2pm lull that always happens.  Also, because I'm at home, I'm not surrounded by expensive snacks and free lunches/dinners at the office.  Just not eating birthday cake whenever someone in the office has a birthday probably saves me a few calories.  

So for the sake of preventing further obescity of America, I advocate stopping the practice of free snacks and meals that are provided at offices around the world.
